# ArduinoBikeCounter

This is a simple program that I made for arduino that works with a 16x2 LCD to display bike stats
It detects pulses from a rotation sensor mounted to the wheel and displays trip data, realtime speed.
It also implements the EEPROM on the arduino to keep tract of total trip distance.

The conversion factor here is for a 26 inch wheel.
